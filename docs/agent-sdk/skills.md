## Overview

Agent Skills extend Claude with specialized capabilities that Claude autonomously invokes when relevant. Skills are packaged as `SKILL.md` files containing instructions, descriptions, and optional supporting resources.

For comprehensive information about Skills, including benefits, architecture, and authoring guidelines, see the [Agent Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

## How Skills Work with the SDK

When using the Claude Agent SDK, Skills are:

1. **Defined as filesystem artifacts**: Created as `SKILL.md` files in specific directories (`.claude/skills/`)
2. **Loaded from filesystem**: Skills are loaded from configured filesystem locations. You must specify `settingSources` (TypeScript) or `setting_sources` (Python) to load Skills from the filesystem
3. **Automatically discovered**: Once filesystem settings are loaded, Skill metadata is discovered at startup from user and project directories; full content loaded when triggered
4. **Model-invoked**: Claude autonomously chooses when to use them based on context
5. **Enabled via allowed\_tools**: Add `"Skill"` to your `allowed_tools` to enable Skills

Unlike subagents (which can be defined programmatically), Skills must be created as filesystem artifacts. The SDK does not provide a programmatic API for registering Skills.

**Default behavior**: By default, the SDK does not load any filesystem settings. To use Skills, you must explicitly configure `settingSources: ['user', 'project']` (TypeScript) or `setting_sources=["user", "project"]` (Python) in your options.

## Using Skills with the SDK

To use Skills with the SDK, you need to:

1. Include `"Skill"` in your `allowed_tools` configuration
2. Configure `settingSources`/`setting_sources` to load Skills from the filesystem

Once configured, Claude automatically discovers Skills from the specified directories and invokes them when relevant to the user's request.

Python

```shiki
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async def main():
 options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
 cwd="/path/to/project", # Project with .claude/skills/
 setting_sources=["user", "project"], # Load Skills from filesystem
 allowed_tools=["Skill", "Read", "Write", "Bash"], # Enable Skill tool
 )

 async for message in query(
 prompt="Help me process this PDF document", options=options
 ):
 print(message)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Skill Locations

Skills are loaded from filesystem directories based on your `settingSources`/`setting_sources` configuration:

- **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`): Shared with your team via git - loaded when `setting_sources` includes `"project"`
- **User Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`): Personal Skills across all projects - loaded when `setting_sources` includes `"user"`
- **Plugin Skills**: Bundled with installed Claude Code plugins

## Creating Skills

Skills are defined as directories containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and Markdown content. The `description` field determines when Claude invokes your Skill.

**Example directory structure**:

```shiki
.claude/skills/processing-pdfs/
└── SKILL.md
```

For complete guidance on creating Skills, including SKILL.md structure, multi-file Skills, and examples, see:

- [Agent Skills in Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills): Complete guide with examples
- [Agent Skills Best Practices](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices): Authoring guidelines and naming conventions

## Tool Restrictions

The `allowed-tools` frontmatter field in SKILL.md is only supported when using Claude Code CLI directly. **It does not apply when using Skills through the SDK**.

When using the SDK, control tool access through the main `allowedTools` option in your query configuration.

To restrict tools for Skills in SDK applications, use the `allowedTools` option:

Import statements from the first example are assumed in the following code snippets.

Python

```shiki
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
 setting_sources=["user", "project"], # Load Skills from filesystem
 allowed_tools=["Skill", "Read", "Grep", "Glob"], # Restricted toolset
)

async for message in query(prompt="Analyze the codebase structure", options=options):
 print(message)
```

## Discovering Available Skills

To see which Skills are available in your SDK application, simply ask Claude:

Python

```shiki
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
 setting_sources=["user", "project"], # Load Skills from filesystem
 allowed_tools=["Skill"],
)

async for message in query(prompt="What Skills are available?", options=options):
 print(message)
```

Claude will list the available Skills based on your current working directory and installed plugins.

## Testing Skills

Test Skills by asking questions that match their descriptions:

Python

```shiki
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
 cwd="/path/to/project",
 setting_sources=["user", "project"], # Load Skills from filesystem
 allowed_tools=["Skill", "Read", "Bash"],
)

async for message in query(prompt="Extract text from invoice.pdf", options=options):
 print(message)
```

Claude automatically invokes the relevant Skill if the description matches your request.

## Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Found

**Check settingSources configuration**: Skills are only loaded when you explicitly configure `settingSources`/`setting_sources`. This is the most common issue:

Python

```shiki
# Wrong - Skills won't be loaded
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Skill"])

# Correct - Skills will be loaded
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
 setting_sources=["user", "project"], # Required to load Skills
 allowed_tools=["Skill"],
)
```

For more details on `settingSources`/`setting_sources`, see the [TypeScript SDK reference](/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript#setting-source) or [Python SDK reference](/docs/en/agent-sdk/python#setting-source).

**Check working directory**: The SDK loads Skills relative to the `cwd` option. Ensure it points to a directory containing `.claude/skills/`:

Python

```shiki
# Ensure your cwd points to the directory containing .claude/skills/
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
 cwd="/path/to/project", # Must contain .claude/skills/
 setting_sources=["user", "project"], # Required to load Skills
 allowed_tools=["Skill"],
)
```

See the "Using Skills with the SDK" section above for the complete pattern.

**Verify filesystem location**:

```shiki
# Check project Skills
ls .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md

# Check personal Skills
ls ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

### Skill Not Being Used

**Check the Skill tool is enabled**: Confirm `"Skill"` is in your `allowedTools`.

**Check the description**: Ensure it's specific and includes relevant keywords. See [Agent Skills Best Practices](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices#writing-effective-descriptions) for guidance on writing effective descriptions.
