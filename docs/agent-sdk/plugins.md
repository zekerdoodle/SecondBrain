Plugins allow you to extend Claude Code with custom functionality that can be shared across projects. Through the Agent SDK, you can programmatically load plugins from local directories to add custom slash commands, agents, skills, hooks, and MCP servers to your agent sessions.

## What are plugins?

Plugins are packages of Claude Code extensions that can include:

- **Skills**: Model-invoked capabilities that Claude uses autonomously (can also be invoked with `/skill-name`)
- **Agents**: Specialized subagents for specific tasks
- **Hooks**: Event handlers that respond to tool use and other events
- **MCP servers**: External tool integrations via Model Context Protocol

The `commands/` directory is a legacy format. Use `skills/` for new plugins. Claude Code continues to support both formats for backward compatibility.

For complete information on plugin structure and how to create plugins, see [Plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins).

## Loading plugins

Load plugins by providing their local file system paths in your options configuration. The SDK supports loading multiple plugins from different locations.

TypeScript

```shiki
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

for await (const message of query({
 prompt: "Hello",
 options: {
 plugins: [
 { type: "local", path: "./my-plugin" },
 { type: "local", path: "/absolute/path/to/another-plugin" }
 ]
 }
})) {
 // Plugin commands, agents, and other features are now available
}
```

### Path specifications

Plugin paths can be:

- **Relative paths**: Resolved relative to your current working directory (for example, `"./plugins/my-plugin"`)
- **Absolute paths**: Full file system paths (for example, `"/home/user/plugins/my-plugin"`)

The path should point to the plugin's root directory (the directory containing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`).

## Verifying plugin installation

When plugins load successfully, they appear in the system initialization message. You can verify that your plugins are available:

TypeScript

```shiki
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

for await (const message of query({
 prompt: "Hello",
 options: {
 plugins: [{ type: "local", path: "./my-plugin" }]
 }
})) {
 if (message.type === "system" && message.subtype === "init") {
 // Check loaded plugins
 console.log("Plugins:", message.plugins);
 // Example: [{ name: "my-plugin", path: "./my-plugin" }]

 // Check available commands from plugins
 console.log("Commands:", message.slash_commands);
 // Example: ["/help", "/compact", "my-plugin:custom-command"]
 }
}
```

## Using plugin skills

Skills from plugins are automatically namespaced with the plugin name to avoid conflicts. When invoked as slash commands, the format is `plugin-name:skill-name`.

TypeScript

```shiki
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

// Load a plugin with a custom /greet skill
for await (const message of query({
 prompt: "/my-plugin:greet", // Use plugin skill with namespace
 options: {
 plugins: [{ type: "local", path: "./my-plugin" }]
 }
})) {
 // Claude executes the custom greeting skill from the plugin
 if (message.type === "assistant") {
 console.log(message.content);
 }
}
```

If you installed a plugin via the CLI (for example, `/plugin install my-plugin@marketplace`), you can still use it in the SDK by providing its installation path. Check `~/.claude/plugins/` for CLI-installed plugins.

## Complete example

Here's a full example demonstrating plugin loading and usage:

TypeScript

```shiki
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";
import * as path from "path";

async function runWithPlugin() {
 const pluginPath = path.join(__dirname, "plugins", "my-plugin");

 console.log("Loading plugin from:", pluginPath);

 for await (const message of query({
 prompt: "What custom commands do you have available?",
 options: {
 plugins: [{ type: "local", path: pluginPath }],
 maxTurns: 3
 }
 })) {
 if (message.type === "system" && message.subtype === "init") {
 console.log("Loaded plugins:", message.plugins);
 console.log("Available commands:", message.slash_commands);
 }

 if (message.type === "assistant") {
 console.log("Assistant:", message.content);
 }
 }
}

runWithPlugin().catch(console.error);
```

## Plugin structure reference

A plugin directory must contain a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest file. It can optionally include:

```inline-block
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│ └── plugin.json # Required: plugin manifest
├── skills/ # Agent Skills (invoked autonomously or via /skill-name)
│ └── my-skill/
│ └── SKILL.md
├── commands/ # Legacy: use skills/ instead
│ └── custom-cmd.md
├── agents/ # Custom agents
│ └── specialist.md
├── hooks/ # Event handlers
│ └── hooks.json
└── .mcp.json # MCP server definitions
```

- [Plugins reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference) - Technical specifications and schemas

## Common use cases

### Development and testing

Load plugins during development without installing them globally:

```shiki
plugins: [{ type: "local", path: "./dev-plugins/my-plugin" }];
```

### Project-specific extensions

Include plugins in your project repository for team-wide consistency:

```shiki
plugins: [{ type: "local", path: "./project-plugins/team-workflows" }];
```

### Multiple plugin sources

Combine plugins from different locations:

```shiki
plugins: [
 { type: "local", path: "./local-plugin" },
 { type: "local", path: "~/.claude/custom-plugins/shared-plugin" }
];
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not loading

If your plugin doesn't appear in the init message:

1. **Check the path**: Ensure the path points to the plugin root directory (containing `.claude-plugin/`)
2. **Validate plugin.json**: Ensure your manifest file has valid JSON syntax
3. **Check file permissions**: Ensure the plugin directory is readable

### Skills not appearing

If plugin skills don't work:

1. **Use the namespace**: Plugin skills require the `plugin-name:skill-name` format when invoked as slash commands
2. **Check init message**: Verify the skill appears in `slash_commands` with the correct namespace
3. **Validate skill files**: Ensure each skill has a `SKILL.md` file in its own subdirectory under `skills/` (for example, `skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`)

### Path resolution issues

If relative paths don't work:

1. **Check working directory**: Relative paths are resolved from your current working directory
2. **Use absolute paths**: For reliability, consider using absolute paths
3. **Normalize paths**: Use path utilities to construct paths correctly
