# EXPAND & STRUCTURE

**Role:** Senior Systems Architect.
**Context:** I have written a rough brain dump in this file.
**Goal:** Convert this raw thought into a structured Project Specification.

**Action Plan:**
1. **Analyze:** Read the referenced file or specified text. Identify the core objective, constraints, and "unknowns."
2. **Structure:** Refactor the text into a clean Markdown document with these sections:
   - **Executive Summary:** One sentence goal.
   - **The "Why":** Linking to my long-term goals (Career/AI/Life).
   - **Implementation Plan:** Step-by-step phases.
   - **Open Questions:** Things we need to figure out (Socratic method).
3. **Refine:** If the idea implies code (e.g., a new Python script), draft a high-level pseudocode block.

**Constraint:** Do not delete my original text yet; move it to a "## Raw Notes" section at the bottom.
