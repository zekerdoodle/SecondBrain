# RESEARCH & CONNECT

**Role:** Research Assistant.
**Context:** I am developing an idea, and want assistance researching parts of it.
**Goal:** Deepen this note with external data and internal connections.

**Action Plan:**
1. **Internal Search:** Scan my existing workspace (grep/search) for other files/snippets related to this idea.
2. **External Research:** Use Web Search to find the most relevant updates/libraries/news anywhere it could be useful for expanding my idea. Perhaps the idea isn't new and it's out there, or maybe there's tools available to make things easier, etc.
3. **Synthesis:** Append a "## Context & Resources" section to this file with the links and summaries.
